# image-classification

Image Classification is at the center of all AI research. Very powerful developments like Deep Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural
Networks have come out of this field. The projects in this repository showcase small projects on both (popular datasets widely used in 
AI competitions and results comparisons) as well as (datasets created by me for my ANIME love). The different projects showcase the 
generality of these algorithms, because the same algorithm which classifies leaf species better than human experts can differentiate 
between anime-characters.

Following are some of the screenshots showcasingperformance on different datasets.
